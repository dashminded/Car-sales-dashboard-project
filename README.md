# Car Sales Dashboard Project

This project was completed as part of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** on Coursera, specifically in the course **Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos**.

It is divided into two main parts:

---

## 📊 Part 1: Excel-Based Visualizations

**Folder**: `excel-visualizations/`  
**File**: `CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx`

- Created charts (bar, column, line), pivot tables, and dashboards using Excel.
- Based on the dataset from IBM Accelerator Catalog.

---

## 📈 Part 2: Interactive Dashboard with Google Looker Studio

**Folder**: `looker-dashboard/`  
**File**: `Sales_and_Service_Dashboard.pdf`

- Built interactive dashboards with KPIs and filters.
- Used Google Looker Studio (due to limited Cognos access).
- PDF and screenshots included for visual reference.
